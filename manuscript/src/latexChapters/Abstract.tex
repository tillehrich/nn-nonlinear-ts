\paragraph{\textbf Abstract.}

This thesis aims to illustrate the usage of Neural Networks in the prediction of nonlinear time series and their performance compared to traditional time series methods.
Underlying theory is briefly layed out, with emphasis on detecting
nonlinearity in time series with appropriate testing. Furthermore, ARIMA models, as well
as Neural Networks are described and their forecasting accuracy is compared based on U.S. housing starts data.
As a result, no clear dominance of one model type over the other can be established.
